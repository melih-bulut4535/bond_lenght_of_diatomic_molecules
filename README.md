# bond_lenght_of_diatomic_molecules
A Python implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method for finding the root of a potential energy function
V(r)=−re2​+a⋅e−r/p
Calculates equilibrium distance r for a given potential.
Prints each iteration step with r and V(r).
User inputs: initial guess, tolerance, and maximum number of iterations.
Useful for numerical methods, physics simulations, and molecular modeling.
